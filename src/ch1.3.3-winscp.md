## Guide
### Downloading

Go to https://winscp.net 

Click the green “Download Now” 

Click the green “Download WinSCP x.x.x (xx MB)” 

Wait for the .exe to download. If it does not download, click the green “Direct Download” 

Run the .exe 

Select install mode “Install for me only” 

“Accept” the License Agreement 

Select setup type “Typical installation (recommended)” and click “Next” 

Select your preferred user interface style (this guide will assume you chose Commander) and click “Next” 

Click on “Install” 

Let the program install. Click on “Finish”. This will launch WinSCP and open the “Getting started” page in your default browser 

### Copying the assignment over

You will be prompted with a “Login” screen 

In “Host name”, enter “grail.eecs.csuohio.edu” 

In “User name”, enter the first 2 letters of your first name, followed by the first 6 letters of your last name. This is the default user name for students. You might have a different user name depending on the length and popularity of your names. You should have gotten an email with your user name and password for your account. If you did not receive one, ask your instructor for assistance 

In “Password”, enter your student ID followed by the first letter of your last name, capitalized (ex. 1234567A) 

Click “Save”, then click “OK” (this will let you easily enter grail again during later sessions) 

Click “Login” 

Enter your password again and click “OK” 

Click “Accept” 

The left side is your home computer directory. Navigate to the file you want to transfer over. The “..” folder takes you up one directory 

Once you have located the file, drag it from the left side and drop it on the right side. Alternatively, you can locate the file on your computer without WinSCP, then drag and drop it from your computer to the right side 

Before copying over, you might want to create a folder on your remote account to keep it organized. To do this, click the “New” button above the right side, click “Directory...”, choose a name for the folder, then click “OK” 

Once the file has been copied over, you are now ready to turn it in 

### Turning the assignment in

On the right side, navigate to the folder you put your file in 

Click on the black “Open terminal” button near the top of the program 

Click “OK” if it asks “Do you want to open a separate shell session?” 

In the “Enter command” box, type the turnin command that your instructor has told you to use. If you are unsure of this command, ask your instructor 

You should see a line in the terminal saying “Your files have been submitted to ‘class, homework’ for grading” indicating a successful turnin
