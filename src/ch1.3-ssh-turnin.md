# How to Submit Assignments using SSH on Windows

Several of the Computer Science classes at **Cleveland State University** use the custom `turnin` command available on the `grail.eecs.csuohio.edu` server to turn in assignments.

On Windows, we recommend using [Mobaxterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) as your SSH client. We also provide guides for using [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) and [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php).

## CSU Server Account Format

**Username:** `<first two letters of your first name (lowercase)><first six letters of your last name (lowercase)>`
\
**Password:** `<CSU ID><first letter of your last name (uppercase)>`

<div class="warning">

Because your CSU ID is known by instructors and many other staff, **you _MUST_ change your password after the first time you log in**.

#### Example

For John Doe with a CSU ID of 1234567:

**Username:** `jodoe` (since "Doe" is only 3 letters, we simply use those 3 letters)
\
**Password:** `1234567D`
